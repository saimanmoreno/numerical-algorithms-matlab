# numerical algorithms with matlab

The goal of numerical analysis is the design and analysis of methods and algorithms to give approximate but 
accurate solutions to problems with no analytical expression of its solution. 

On one hand, the subject cover classical topics in numerical analysis: direct and iterative methods of solution of 
linear systems, least-squares, numerical computation of eigenvalues, interpolation, numerical differentiation and 
integration and solving initial value problem for ordinary differential equations. On the other, it introduces on 
more advanced topics as trigonometric interpolation, solution of nonlinear systems of equations and solutions of
partial differential equations.

The course will have a focus on the study of numerical methods, but also require you to use numerical software,
the recitation will give an introduction to MATLAB during the first lesson.
